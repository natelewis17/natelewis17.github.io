<h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>

Japanese is widely considered to have one of the most complex written systems with two unique syllabries hiragana (ひらがな) and katakana (カタカナ) being used in conjunction with characters that originated in China known as kanji (漢字). While the process for learning hiragana and katakana is relatively straightforward for beginners with 46 characters in each syllabry, kanji is a little more complex. You see, there are approximately 50,000 kanji characters with over 2,000 being deemed necessary to being considered fluent. Making matters worse, kanji are considerably more complicated than the other writing systems with upwards of 20 strokes needed to create some of the more complex singular characters. As someone who has been studying actively for 2 years I can only claim to know about 1,000 kanji with confidence. The task of learning these 2,000 or more characters is daunting for any learner. So the question is: Where do I even begin?

The most obvious answer to this question is to start with the most common and therefore the most essential ones. But how does one know which are most common and is the even the best way to learn? My goal with this project is to help answer these questions by looking at the frequency of kanji usage on the website Wikipedia.com.
