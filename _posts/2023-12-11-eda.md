<h2>Introduction</h2>

Where does a Japanese learner begin when facing the daunting challenge of learning thousands of kanji? This is the question that motivated me to do this project and the one I hope to help answer in this blog post. Hopefully by looking at my compiled data concerning kanji frequencies from Wikipedia in conjunction with other sources, the answer to this question will be slightly clearer.

<h2>What are the Most Common Kanji on Wikipedia?</h2>

The top 3 most common kanji are 年、月、and　日. If you were considering using Wikipedia as a source of reading practice in Japanese, expect to be reading a whole lot of dates. Curioiusly, we also see that kanjis 4-8 are all non-N5 level, which is an indicator that the JLPT may not be the definitive ranking for usefullness of kanji, which will be explored more in final section of this post.

Now we will briefly look at how complex the kanji that are appearing on Wikipedia are. To be clear, when I say complexity I mean how complicated they are to write not necessarily how complicated the ideas they represent are.

We see from here that the most common number of strokes for kanji is in the 4-10 range. However, there is still a tangible amount of frequency going all the way up to 21.

As described in the previous blog post, the Joyo list is the list of 2,136 kanji deemed by the Japanese government to be necessary to be considered fluent in Japanese. The question is how common are non-Joyo kanji and which characters beyond this list are the most essential for learners.

Here we see that while 17.4% of unique kanjis from my DataFrame are non-Joyo, the frequency with which they appear on Wikipedia is only 1.3%. This means that while many there are a fairly large amount of non_Joyo kanji that appear, most of them do not show up with much consistency. The five most common non-Joyo kanji from my sampled Wikipedia pages are:
1. 蘭 (orchid, Holland) - rank 550
2. 智 (wisdom, intellect, reason) - rank 783
3. 之 (of, this) - rank 785
4. 幌 (canopy, awning, hood, curtain) - rank 814
5. 乃 (from, possessive particle, whereupon, accordingly) - rank 825

Any intermediate Japanese learners looking at this post should consider adding these kanji to their study list/flashcard deck.

The final thing in this section is we'll be looking at which radicals appear in the most kanji. Radicals are the building blocks of Kanji. For example the kanji 間　is composed of the radicals 門　and 日。Due to the complexity of printing radicals (radicals can have different forms and positions) I will be using the number codes for the radicals. Breaking down these numbers would be a bit too complex for this blog post, but more information can be found [here](https://www.joyokanji.com/radical-notes).

<h2>How do Frequencies Differ Across Sources?</h2>

Of course the question of frequency of kanji is not a new one, but I think the approach to defining frequnecy is often flawed. Most dictionaries (such as the very popular [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/search/%E9%96%A3%20%23kanji)) will define the frequnecy of kanji based on how often they appear in Japanese newspapers. This isn't necessarily a bad way to define frequency, but for learners it can also be misleading as to how essential some kanji are. For example the kanji 閣 is rated as the 444th most common kanji in newspapers. This would indicate that its frequency is around what a late beginner/early intermediate learner should be looking at. This kanji, however, has essentially only one word it is used in which means cabinet as in the presidential cabinet. While this word is certainly worth knowing, I don't think anyone would argue this character should be a higher priority for learners than 母 (mother) which is ranked as the 570th kanji in newspapers. 

Other less common methods of ranking kanji frequency also exist such as frequency in manga or frequency in novels, but these methods have similar issues with niche language being overrated. Looking at Wikipedia instead of newspapers or manga does not eliminate the overrating of niche kanji, but by seeing a ranking of frequency in multiple types of sources side by side learners get a more complete view of what is essential and what can be saved for later.

From this plot we can see that as expected there are a lot of kanji that are similar in frequency across different types of sources. It comes as no surprise that "行" (go) is extremely common across all types of sources and "唄" (song praising Buddha) is infrequently used in newspapers, novels, and Wikipedia. The most interesting thing to look at here is what are the kanji that have the widest difference in usage across different sources. The five  kanji with the highest mean difference between sources are:

1. 票 (ballot, label, ticket, sign)
2. 該 (above-stated, the said, that specific)
3. 訂 (revise, correct, decide)
4. 項 (paragraph, nape of neck, clause, item, term (expression))
5. 栽 (plantation, planting)

It is easy to imagine why these five characters maybe more common in newspapers specifically than in other sources.
